# ‚è≥ vitrum‚è≥ 

Implementation of various analysis methods commonly used for disordered and glassy material structures.

Package is built as an extension to the ASE python package


## üéØ Scope and functionality

### Working implementations
| Analysis method | Class method |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Partial Radial distribution functions | .get_rdf() |
| Total radial distribution function | get_total_rdf() | 
| Angle distribution function | .get_angular_dist() |
| Coordination number | .get_coordination_number() |
| Qn analysis | .get_qn() |
