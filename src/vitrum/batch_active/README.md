# Batch active learning ACE (BALACE) 

Framework for parameterizing interatomic potential using ACE for disordered material systems.

The package is build around submitting various jobs to a queing system using Fireworks with JobFlow and Atomate2

DFT calculations setup to be performed in VASP
ML-MD simulations are conducted in LAMMPS

# Requirements

Lammps installation with the ML-PACE package
VASP installation
Setup FireWorks launchpad with a MongoDB
