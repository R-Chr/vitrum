# Scattering

The scattering class contains functions for calculating scattering functions of materials, as averaged over a list of Extended ASE Atoms objects.

Included functions:
- Radial distribution function: g$_{ij}$(r)
- Total pair distribution function: G(r)
- Partial structure factor: A$_{ij}$(q)
- Structure factor: S(q)

For the G(r) and S(q) both neutron and x-ray scattering versions are available.
